# odin-recipes
Odin Recipes is a beginner-friendly project focused on building a simple website using HTML only.

The homepage includes links to multiple recipes across different categories such as desserts, starters, and main courses. Each recipe page contains:

A brief description of the dish

A list of required ingredients

Step-by-step instructions for preparation

This project helps reinforce fundamental HTML concepts like structuring content, linking pages, and using semantic elements.
